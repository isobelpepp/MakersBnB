# Makers Bnb

## Intro

This project is a basic mock up of AirBnB. Some of the code will be taken from a group project I did earlier in the course, which can be found here: https://github.com/karimabuseer/makersbnb.

### Set Up

- Set up makersbnb and makersbnb_test databases. In psql
```
CREATE DATABASE makersbnb;
CREATE DATABASE makersbnb_test;
```
- Run SQL queries savesdin db/migrations to set up both databases with the tables
